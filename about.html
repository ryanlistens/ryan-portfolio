```
<p>I'm a writer and communicator who makes complex things clear. I've spent the last decade documenting enterprise software for Microsoft, crafting donor campaigns for environmental nonprofits, and writing policy content for criminal justice reform.</p>

<p>I grew up in the Boston area and built my career there through 2021, working across marketing agencies, higher ed institutions, and advocacy organizations. When the industry tightened and Boston's cost of living became unsustainable, I relocated—first to Philadelphia, then Buffalo—looking for cities where I could afford to live while continuing to work. I'm currently in Niantic, Connecticut with family and two dogs.</p>

<p>I've been making music and doing comedy for years, solo and collaboratively. I write constantly. Out of all that—the passion for creating things people react to—I've built a career in communications and marketing. I learn new tools and platforms quickly. I'm good at communicating human stories, translating organizational missions, and turning complex knowledge bases into content that's accessible and actionable for any audience.</p>

<h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
<p>Environmental organizations, mission-driven nonprofits, and companies that need someone who can handle technical documentation, UX writing, internal communications, and content strategy.</p>

<h3>What I Bring</h3>
<p>A decade of proven experience. The ability to learn fast and adapt. A track record of producing work that serves its purpose.</p>
