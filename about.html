<h2>About</h2>

<p>I'm a writer and communicator who's spent the last decade making complex things clear—whether that's documenting enterprise software for Microsoft, crafting donor campaigns for environmental nonprofits, or writing policy content for criminal justice reform.</p>

<p>I grew up in the Boston area and built my career there through 2021, working across marketing agencies, higher ed institutions, and advocacy organizations. When the industry tightened and Boston's cost of living became unsustainable, I relocated—first to Philadelphia, then Buffalo—looking for cities where I could afford to live while continuing to work. I'm currently in Niantic, Connecticut with family, focused on getting back into environmental and mission-driven communications.</p>

<p>Outside the 9-to-5, I write dark fiction about industrial systems and community resistance, perform stand-up comedy, make music, and think a lot about how things break and how they could be built better. I see connections between technical documentation and storytelling, between corporate messaging and satire—it's all communication, just for different purposes.</p>

<p>What I bring: clarity under pressure, the ability to translate between technical and human language, and a track record of producing work that moves people—whether that's engineers understanding a new process or donors supporting a cause they believe in.</p>
